# What is Apps Script Used For?

- Apps Script was initially released by Google back in August, 2009. <br />

- It lets you use code to manipulate, customize and <em><strong>automate</strong></em> Google Applications like Drive, Docs and Sheets among others. <br />

- Apps Script uses JavaScript, so your existing knowledge of JavaScript will work with Apps Script as well.<br /> 

- Apps Script also uses its own functions that help you connect to Google Applications. <br />

- We use the Apps Script Tool to deploy our code. The Dashboard can be found at [script.google.com](script.google.com)
